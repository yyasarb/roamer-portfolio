    "about-intro": "Before anything else, let me prove I actually understand what you do.",
    "about-col-1": "You do not just make content. You build brands that feel like something. Drobe Media, Anker Bak Studio, Global Startup Awards, Dignity Design. Four brands, four voices, one standard: never generic, never corporate.",
    "about-col-2": "But running four brands without losing personality does not happen by accident. Someone needs to build the workflows, own the publishing rhythm, and make sure every post, email, and video feels intentional across every platform.",
    "about-outro": "That someone is me. And I brought receipts.",
    "clients-intro": "Now let\u2019s talk about me. But briefly, I promise.",

    "proof-left": "You need someone who can manage four brands without making them sound like the same brand. That is not just content creation. That is a system. And I love systems.",
    "proof-step-1-title": "01 / Build the Workflow",
    "proof-step-1-desc": "One publishing engine that serves four brands. Notion as the central hub for calendars, briefs, and brand guidelines. Buffer or Later for scheduling across platforms. Beehiiv or Mailchimp for email. The system runs even when I am grabbing that overpriced Danish coffee.",
    "proof-step-2-title": "02 / Protect the Personality",
    "proof-step-2-desc": "Every brand gets its own tone, its own rhythm, its own visual language. Figma and Canva for templated design that stays on-brand but moves fast. Drobe sounds like Drobe. Dignity Design sounds like Dignity Design. No copy-paste energy. Ever.",
    "proof-step-3-title": "03 / Use AI as a Multiplier",
    "proof-step-3-desc": "Claude and ChatGPT for research, first drafts, and content variations. Adobe Generative AI for visuals that need to move faster than the brief. AI handles the repetitive parts. That frees me up for the part machines cannot do: taste.",
    "proof-step-4-title": "04 / Track and Adapt",
    "proof-step-4-desc": "Google Analytics and Search Console for tracking what actually works. Every post, every campaign, every email gets measured. What works gets more. What does not gets reworked. No vanity metrics. The system scales. The creativity stays human.",
    "proof-closing": "If you have scrolled this far, I think we both know what comes next.",
    "closing-heading": "I am <span class=\"closing-name\">Paul Frost</span>. Based in Malm\u00F6, a short train ride from your N\u00F8rrebro office. I have survived the Arctic Circle, so a Danish winter commute feels like a holiday.",
